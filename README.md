## General info
I made this beautiful mini project using JavaScript and DOM concepts.
I really enjoyed working on this project and spent any time I could on it.
* It's a front end based website.
* Used HTML to built this website and gave a structure to the website 
* Used CSS to design the website at various places like buttons, text alignments, giving different colours to the website etc 
* Used JavaScript to gave some functionality to the webpage like added sounds when you press the buttons with the help of EventListener and to give animations to the button.
